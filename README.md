# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is a machine learning application developed in Python to predict housing prices based on various features such as area, number of bathrooms, stories, air conditioning, and furnishing status. Using exploratory data analysis and model training, this project aims to create an accessible way to evaluate housing prices for prospective buyers.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - **pandas**: For data loading, manipulation, and preprocessing.
  - **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization to understand feature relationships.
  - **scikit-learn**: For building, training, and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loaded a housing dataset and explored relationships between features.
2. **Data Preparation**: Processed data by handling categorical values, removing outliers, and selecting relevant features.
3. **Model Building**: Built a regression model to predict housing prices and tuned it based on accuracy.
4. **Evaluation and Application**: Tested model performance and demonstrated its application in housing price estimation.
